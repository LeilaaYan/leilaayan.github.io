In this R Markdown report, we analyze and compare three methods for quantifying Per- and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances (PFAS) levels across the 52 U.S. states. Our objective is to visualize the relationship between cancer incidence and varying pollution levels, enabling a clearer understanding of the geographic distribution and potential health impacts of PFAS exposure.


Read in the three datasets
```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# US states cancer incidence dataset
fifitystates_df = read_excel("Excel_50 states.xlsx") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
fifitystates_df

# US zipcode dataset
zipcode_df = read_excel ("US_FIPS_Codes.xls") %>%
  janitor::clean_names()
zipcode_df

# PFAS level dataset
pfas_df= read_csv ("pfas_county_073124.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  mutate(state_zipcode= substr(county, 1, 2))
pfas_df
